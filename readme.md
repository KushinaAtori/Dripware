# Dripware V1.0.0
I know I know, it says scripthub but, it's just for my research in UI development using Lua on the Roblox platform. Most likely, the scripts that are added into the "scripthub" don't work or have no security for ban protection and what not. I want to explore how User Interfaces work and theme choices. The reason most scripts on here are placeholders is just to APPEAL to the exploit community. I know that the GUI sits in PlayerGUI and not CoreGUI I have reasons and was just lazy to change a couple lines of code.

## Installation
To use dripware you should run the loader first! This is for security and hub updates and to make sure everything is working smoothly. Of course its just a mock-up and you can run the GUI just fine since it's nothing crazy


## Inspiration
If you look at my previous repos I have stuff called Exchange Lib and whatnot. This gui derives from a poor memory of how it looked like. But it was the idea from the EzHub Team.


## Executor Requirements
>none

In fact you could probably run it on KRNL if you had too! Synapse X is just recommended because swapping executors is very lame,..
